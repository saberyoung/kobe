What is KOBE?
==================
	   
`Key Observing Block Establishment (KOBE) <https://sngyang.com/kobe>`_ is an open source Python package that help develop `observing blocks (OBs) <http://www.not.iac.es/news/reports/stc/49/node32.html>`_ for ground-based astronomical telescopes, aiming to optimize observations in order to monitor a trigger efficiently.

Modern synoptic surveys monitored large sky volume, aiming at detecting the variability of astronomical sources with high cadence in different messenger channels.
Such transiting sources are deemed to be very important ingredients for astronomers to learn physics in extreme conditions.
However in recent years, the dramatic increasing of dataset is challenging for the efficient identification and further follow-up of transient sources.
The followup search of certain triggers could increase the confidence of astronomers to assign rare observing resources to those fast transients.
For instance, the detection of kilonova AT2017gfo, that was detected by a followup search of the LIGO GW trigger, GW170817, marks the success of such trigger search.
However in the meantime, we should be aware that GW170817 was quite special trigger that it's very close, well localized and associate with gamma ray emissions.
In fact, currently the localization regions of GW events are still formidably large, being of order around 1000 square degree for two detector events, and 10-100 square degree for three.
The localization problem would be probably better in other meseenger channels, but still with difficulties.
Thus, we provide `KOBE`, a Python based package that can assist to build up pointing list for multiple telescopes, increasing the overall efficiency of EM counterpart searches in the multi-messenger astronomy era.

`KOBE` provides utilities to:

* handle and evaluate (GW/GRB/AMON/etc) triggers.
* generate pointing list for telescopes with various of searching strategy.
* coordinate, visualize, and assess the followup search efficiency.
* optimize observing strategy in order to effectively accumulate trigger probability, with inclusion of field visibility and other factors.
* circulate to users for a real time search.
